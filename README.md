## ü•Ç Use Case

Maya is a proof-of-concept agentic AI bartender for "MOK-5ha" (Moksha) - a philosophically-themed bar where liberation meets libation. The agent can:

- **Take Complex Orders**: Process multi-item drink orders with modifiers and customizations
- **Make Personalized Recommendations**: Suggest drinks based on customer preferences (sobering, classy, fruity, strong, burning)
- **Engage in Meaningful Conversation**: Conduct philosophical discussions while maintaining professional bartending service
- **Manage Complete Transactions**: Handle ordering, billing, tips, and payment processes
- **Provide Multi-Modal Experience**: Respond with both text and high-quality voice synthesis

---

## ü´ó How It Works

1. **Customer Interaction**: Users interact through a Gradio web interface with text input
2. **Order Processing**: Maya processes natural language requests using Google's Gemini frontier model
3. **State Management**: The system maintains conversation history and order state across interactions
4. **Voice Response**: Maya responds with both text and synthesized speech via Cartesia API
5. **Transaction Completion**: Maya handles billing, tips, and provides order summaries

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+**
2. **API Keys**:
   - Google Gemini API key
   - Cartesia API key (for text-to-speech)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MOK-5-ha/MayaBartendingAgent.git
   cd MayaBartendingAgent
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
   export CARTESIA_API_KEY="your_cartesia_api_key_here"
   ```

3. **Run the submission notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/submission_notebook.ipynb
   ```

   Or open directly in your preferred Jupyter environment and run all cells.

### Kaggle Deployment

The notebook is designed to run seamlessly on Kaggle with API keys stored as Kaggle Secrets:
- Add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and `CARTESIA_API_KEY` to Kaggle Secrets
- Import and run the submission notebook
- All dependencies are installed automatically within the notebook
